__IDEA:__ 

The father takes her daughter out for a late night walk, during the walk there is heavy wind and a faint whisper. Later some sort of creature snatches the girl and runs. The father sets off in the woods to find the __*monster*__, and get her daughter

__THE BASICS OF THE GAME:__

The player will have to repeatedly pick one of the three paths given, and each of those three paths will have one of the following things mentioned below:

- *Monster* -> If you click this path you lose the game.

- *Item*    -> If you click this path, you obtain an item.

- *Safe Path*    -> If you click this path you either receive a battery or flashlight.

__ITEM USAGE INFO:__

There are items that you can collect in the game, and use it to get you through the game.


__Flashlight__:
* Collect __*batteries*__
    - You already have a __*flashlight*__ so no need to make one, just collect batteries.
    - Reveals where the monster is.

__Fire Lamp__:
*  You need __*matches*__ 
    - You have a fire lamp, so no need to collect one 
    - Reveals the path that has an item.

__Deagle__: 
*  You need a __*Pistol*__ and a __*Magazine*__
    - You can now hunt down the monster, but be wise since you have to guess 
    what path the monster is on. 
        - If you miss, you have wasted a __*bullet*__, and need to collect another one to try again.
