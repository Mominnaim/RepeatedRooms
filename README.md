GOAL: the goal of the game is to kill the monster and get your daughter back.
* It is a game of pick on the three paths

                                          -> Demon path (LOSE)

                                          -> Item path (Collect_item)

                                          -> Lore_path (Find the backstory of the monster)
    

    REMEMBER: -> You already have a flashlight and all you need is a "Battery" to use:
        Using this item will reveal where the mosnter is. 

    BLUEPRINT OF ITEM CRAFTING:
        -> "Matches" and "Wooden stick" = Torch:
            Lights up the path where the item is.
        
        -> "Pistol", and "Magazine", and "Gundpowder":
            Obtain a "Deagle" where you load up "Bullets" to kill the demon
                if you miss the demon path, then you have had wasted a bullet.
