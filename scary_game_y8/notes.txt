April 6th - Need to be able to get the paths working!

---->
This is what is not working, The buttons only log 'yes' from first button to third button and repeat. I need it to log yes no matter what the order, and 
also repeat the loop. 

For some reason the path is not being sent to the game_engine, and is rather given no input.

The buttons are working but its not making the while loop wait it just keeps on running. On top of that, the paths are still not displaying
